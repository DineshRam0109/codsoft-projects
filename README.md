Codsoft Internship - Task Completion
Overview
This repository contains the projects and tasks completed as part of the Codsoft Internship. Each task showcases different skills and techniques in software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.


Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
Description: Developed a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. This involved using if-else statements and pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.
Technology Used: Python
Outcome: A functional rule-based chatbot that demonstrates basic natural language processing and conversation flow.


Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Description: Implemented an AI agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player using the Minimax algorithm. The AI is designed to be unbeatable, ensuring that it either wins or results in a draw.
Technology Used: Python
Outcome: A Tic-Tac-Toe game with a strong AI opponent that demonstrates an understanding of game theory and search algorithms.


Task 4: Recommendation System
Description: Created a recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering were employed to recommend movies, books, or products.
Technology Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Outcome: A functional recommendation system that demonstrates a basic understanding of machine learning techniques for personalized recommendations.


Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition
Description: Developed an AI application for detecting and recognizing faces in images or videos. This included using pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades and deep learning-based face detectors, with optional face recognition capabilities.
Technology Used: Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascades, Deep Learning
Outcome: A robust face detection and recognition system, highlighting expertise in computer vision and deep learning.
